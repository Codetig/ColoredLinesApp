# ColoredLinesApp
Displays the content of a given file in colored lines.

##Purpose
It is sometimes hard to read text in for people with certain eyes defects,
like astigmatism. This app shows the text with lines alternating colors.
This should make it easier to follow a line and not jump from lines , which
makes reading harder and more frustrating.
